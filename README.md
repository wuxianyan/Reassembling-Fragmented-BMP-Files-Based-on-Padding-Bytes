# Reassembling-Fragmented-BMP-Files-Based-on-Padding-Bytes

Our work is still running under a project and this project is not finished yet. After the project been finished (several months), we will upload our code for the proposed method  in "Reassembling fragmented BMP files based on padding
bytes" and our implementation for the eight algorithms in "Automated reassembly of file fragmented images using greedy algorithms".
